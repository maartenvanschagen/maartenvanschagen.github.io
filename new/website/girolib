    GyroLib is a library that makes it simple to use a mems sensor.
    
    The library is structured in such a way that it is easy to add support
    for different types of mems sensors, or for different platforms. And
    every platform will be compatible with every sensor.
    
    <t style="color:lightblue">How it works</t>
    
    The library can read measurements from the mems sensor, and
    calculate its rotation. It does this integrating every gyroscope
    measurement. Then it continuously nudges the result towards the
    rotation measured by the accelerometer.
    
    Rotations are represented a quaternion.
